Step 1 => Create a repository in Gti hub portal 
Step 2 => Git clone to create the remote in local
Step 3 => Git config --global user.name "ourusername" ==>>>>> This will set the credentials for all the git repository
Step 4 => Git config --globa user.email "ouremail"
Step 5 => Git config user.name "ourusername" ==>>>>> This will set the credentials for particular git repository
Step 6 => To add the files to Commit => Git add filename filename
to add many files =>> git add .
to ignore one file ==>> git ignore filename

We have many stages
 Working Directory => Staging Area => Local Repo => Remote Repo

 Working Directory is the one where we are wokring that is making changes
 Staging Area is the one where the files will go after we did git add command
 Local Repo is the one where the files will go after we did git commit -m "commit messages"
 Remote Repo is the one where the files will go after we did git push origin master


Create a new project and initialize a git from local
 To initialize and create the project with git => git init newProjectname
 this will create and initialize a project but not in remote 
 
Create  a project in github website and clone in local
git clone thaturl => this will clone a project in local

Make the existing project as Git Repo
git init => this will initialize a new repository 
git remote add URL

To do add and commit in one command
git commit -am "message to commit"

git ls-files => this command will show all trackking files

if we moved the files from working Directory to Staging Area using git add command but really dont want to stage that changes
to do unstage the changes => git reset HEAD filename
when we give this command the files moved back from staging area to working directory but whaterve the chnges we have donr in that fine will be there.


to rename the file 
git mv filename filename  => example == git mv level3-file.txt level3.txt

To remove files from staging area
git rm filename


To get the history
git log
